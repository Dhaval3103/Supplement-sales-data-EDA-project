# Supplement-sales-data-EDA-project
Welcome to the **Supplement Sales Analysis** project! This repository contains a Python-based data analysis and visualization project focused on exploring sales data for various supplements. Using the "Supplement Sales Analysis.csv" dataset, the project generates detailed insights into monthly revenue trends, category and product performance, location-based popularity, and seasonal patterns from January 2020 to March 2025. The visualizations are created using Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib for plotting.

## Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of supplement sales, covering 16 unique products across 10 categories (e.g., Protein, Vitamin, Mineral, Performance) sold in the USA, UK, and Canada via platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and iHerb. Key metrics include revenue, units sold, discounts, returns, and location-specific trends.

### Key Features
- **Category Analysis**: Bar charts displaying total revenue and units sold by category.
- **Product Analysis**: Detailed bar charts for individual products.
- **Location and Platform Insights**: Grouped bar charts showing popularity by location (Canada, UK, USA) and platform performance.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identification of higher sales throughout the year, with mid-year dips (Juneâ€“Aug), aiding strategic planning.

### Objectives
- Visualize sales performance over time.
- Identify top-performing products and categories.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- **Python 3.x** (recommended: 3.8 or higher)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis)
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn** (for data visualization)
